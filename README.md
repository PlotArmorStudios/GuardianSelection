**How To Use**
**Getting Started**
- There is a folder called “Builds” where you can find the Windows executable for Guardian Selection: Ultimate. 
- Once you have Guardian Selection: Ultimate built or ready to run, open it and you will see an interface on the left side of the screen with character icons and arrows on either side.
- There are a selection of 5 characters of 5 different races. When opening the application, all of their stats are randomly calculated, so you will have a different selection of characters every time you open the application!

**Selecting A Character**
- Pressing the Guardians’ icons will select your current Guardian, and all respective attributes will be predefined and displayed in the right-hand panel.

**Preview Panel**
- Your Guardian’s randomly generated attributes will be displayed in the Preview Panel.

**Randomize Button**
- Use this button to roll the dice and get a whole new selection of Guardians! This is the same way that Guardian attributes are randomized when the application starts, so when you click this button, you will notice that you have a different set of attributes per character to choose from!
